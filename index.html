                        <li style=" padding-bottom:5px;"> Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails
                            from a Hindu Rajput family with roots in Uttarakhand. He is the youngest of three
                            children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.His paternal village Lwali, is in
                            Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. His parents moved
                            from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior
                            management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.[25] Unlike Dhoni,
                            his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".
                            Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football
                            team,[26] but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who
                            inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.[27] His
                            exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the
                            Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked
                            for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed
                            well.
                            From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway
                            station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.

                            Almora district of the Uttarakhand state. The village has population of 20 to 30 families.
                            His father Pan Singh Dhoni left the village in 1970 for employment. He eventually settled in
                            Ranchi. Dhoni's uncle Dhanpat Singh Dhauni and his cousin Hayat Singh Dhauni still live in
                            Lwali.
                            He married Sakshi Singh Rawat on 4 July 2010.

                            Dhoni is an enthusiast of the Indian Army. While spending a day with the parachute regiment
                            in Ranchi, Dhoni said, "Since childhood I wanted to join the Army. Seeing the soldiers, I

                            Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman. He
                            deviates from conventional coaching manuals and showcases his unique batting technique.
                            Dhoni displays a proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on,
                            Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the conventional Cover region. Furthermore, he
                            demonstrates remarkable skill in playing pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched
                            deliveries, putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly.
                            Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with
                            force and precision to clear the boundary. Despite this, he still retains the capability to
                            produce awe-inspiring, long sixes.He is known for his unorthodox captaincy and
                            cool-headed demeanor on the field. As a batsman, he is recognized for his remarkable
                            finishing skills in high-pressure situations, and his aggressive captaincy has earned him
                            the reputation of a successful leader in Indian cricket. He has also been renowned for his
                            lightning-fast glove-work behind the stumps.
                            Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his
                            playing style to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a
                            captain. He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running
                            between the wickets. He made use of the helicopter shot technique, taught to him
                            by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.
                            His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts but also criticised for lack
                            of good technique. He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by
                            any wicket-keeper.
                            As a captain, Dhoni was approachable to players. Former cricketers and opposition
                            players underline that his behaviour on cricket ground was calm and composed. He used to
                            allow his bowlers to set field for themselves.

                            In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice
                            President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited
                            (CCL) team.[30] Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional
                            cricket. At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed
                            exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division.[31] Deval Sahay, impressed by
                            his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team.[32] Dhoni moved to the Ranchi
                            team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one
                            year.

                            Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy
                            and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition for
                            his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season,
                            Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament.
                            Dhoni was part of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy 2003–2004 season
                            and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches, including a century (114) against Central
                            zone.
                            In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to
                            represent East Zone. He scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing
                            cause. Dhoni's talent was discovered via the BCCI's small-town talent-spotting
                            initiative TRDW. Dhoni was discovered by TRDO Prakash Poddar, captain of Bengal in the
                            1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a

                            He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format
                            and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.Against the
                            Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches
                            and 4 stumpings in the match.[55] In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and
                            Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a
                            half-century. Continuing his good performance, he scored back to back centuries –
                            120[57] and 119* against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an
                            average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian
                            captain – Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.

                            The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that
                            the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[59] The team also saw the entry of
                            wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh
                            Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[59] With Dhoni making a mark in
                            the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[60]
                            Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[61]
                            In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI
                            series.

                            India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in
                            the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in
                            the tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni
                            was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists
                            of JMM.The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World
                            Cup in the first round.
                            Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against
                            Bangladesh, after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was
                            declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also
                            later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away.
                            Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a
                            blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.
                            Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland
                            and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series. Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade
